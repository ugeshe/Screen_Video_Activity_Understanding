# Screen Activity Understanding 
This project aims to detect and recognize the characters that are being typed in AOLME WebApp. The frame
difference technique helps us to locate regions with differences in the content between two successive frames. The regions with
potential changes are fed to the CNN model which is trained on the EMNIST dataset to recognize each letter in the corresponding
regions.
